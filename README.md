## Inspiration
As a student, I used to struggle daily with the problem of food preparation. Managing academic work together with meal preparation was not only time-consuming but frustratingly complex, too, when one thinks of healthy nutrition. Based on this personal struggle, I came up with the concept that could help solve this common problem for both students and busy individuals alike.

## What it does
It started off with inspiration from the time and energy loss that I always experienced around everyday cooking. Studying and preparing one meal at a time revealed to me that there is always a significant room for ease that is pretty cost-effective. That started the thinking toward a meal delivery system that aimed to deliver prepackaged meals on demand with pocket-friendly pricing, trying to lighten their stressful lives.

## How we built it
To give it meaning, I started building a front-end-based website for the same using Tailwid, Typescript, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project would include but was not limited to the following features:

* **Home Page:** Having the name of the startup, tagline of the startup, and a one-liner description of what all services the platform would offer.

* **About Page:** State the problem, describe why this service is needed in the present market, and show passion for the same, some sample team name with random people.

- **Contact Page:** This is a form to contact the developers and interested users or investors, and also a small overview of the members of the team.

- **Navigation Bar:** Provides easy access to all important pages on the website.

I built a user-friendly user interface with intuitive navigation that was responsive, so it would behave and look great on many devices. Further interactivity included hover effects, form validation that really made this functional and engaging.

## Challenges we ran into
During the development process even though I used different tools for ideas and inspiration but to complete the project requirements, I faced with the following challenges:

* **Consistency in Design:** The process required an attention to minute details in making sure design consistency across the various pages.

- **Responsive Design:** Ensuring the adaptability of the website on different screen sizes required a lot of testing and tweaking of layout and styling.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I am proud of my ability to create, debug, test and deploy whole website on my own, because of my backend development experience I never trusted myself that I can create a good frontend on my own also. I am glad I took part in this competition and I got to experience my creativity, development speed and the learnings I got.

## What we learned
**Learnings**  The exposure to multiple tools mentioned in the requirements, the creative brainstorming for a captivating idea that would possibly interest myself to build in future and the beautiful and minimalistic end product. I liked the use case of tailwind and type script in the traditional HTML, CSS and JS tech stack.

## What's next for Prep perfect
**Future Scope** I want Prep perfect to be a real startup somedays, and something where homeowners can contribute and pitch in so that it can be an income source for them also.
